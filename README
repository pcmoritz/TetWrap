TetWrap -- A lightweight wrapper around the TetGen library

TetGen (www.tetgen.org) is a high-quality software for tetrahedral
meshing. We provide a very lightweight and hackable wrapper around it
for simplified access to TetGen's capabilities. Althought it uses the
STL, it is designed in such a way that it would be very easy to ceate
a STL-less version of the library.

The following datatypes are available:

point -- A three dimensional point indexed by cartesian coordinates
pcl -- A piecewise linear complex
