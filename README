TetWrap -- A lightweight wrapper around the TetGen library

TetGen (www.tetgen.org) is a high-quality software for tetrahedral
meshing. This library provides a very lightweight and hackable wrapper
around it for simplified access to TetGen's capabilities.

To install the library, just drop a folder containing the source for
tetgen 1.5.0 into a subdirectory tetgen of the project.

The following datatypes are available:

point: A three dimensional point indexed by cartesian coordinates
facet: A surface spanned by vertices which typically lie in a plane
surface: A surface consisting of piecewise linear segments
geometry: A piecewise linear complex with holes

These functions are provided:

read_off: Read a surface from an .off file
generate_input: Construct an object that can then be fed into the
tetrahedralize function of TetGen to produce the actual mesh
get_interior_point: Returns a point that is inside (not on the boundary)
of the provided surface. This can be used for setting up tetgen's hole
structure.

Typically, a few surfaces are read from .off files or constructed by
hand, and then assembled into a geometry object. Then, a tetgenio
object is generated with generate_input. From this object, the mesh is
then generated by TetGen.

An example is provided in main.cpp. To try it out, you have to
download the test data by invoking getdata.py.

If you have comments or suggestions, feel free to contact me. Forks
are encouraged!
